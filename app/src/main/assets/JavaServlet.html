    <b style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Java Servlet</b>&nbsp;API allows a software developer to add dynamic content to a Web server using the Java platform. The generated content is commonly&nbsp;HTML, but may be other data such as&nbsp;XML. Servlets are the Java counterpart to dynamic web content technologies such as CGI, PHP or ASP. Servlets can maintain state across many server transactions by using HTTP cookies, session variables or URL rewriting.</p>

    The Servlet API, contained in the Java package hierarchy javax.servlet, defines the expected interactions of a web container and a servlet. A web container is essentially the component of a web server that interacts with the servlets. The web container is responsible for managing the lifecycle of servlets, mapping a URL to a particular servlet and ensuring that the URL requester has the correct access rights.</p>

    A Servlet is an object that receives requests (ServletRequest) and generates a response (ServletResponse) based on the request. The API package javax.servlet.http defines HTTP subclasses of the generic servlet (HttpServlet) request (HttpServletRequest) and response (HttpServletResponse) as well as an (HttpSession) that tracks multiple requests and responses between the web server and a client. Servlets may be packaged in a WAR file as a Web application.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    Moreover, servlets can be generated automatically by&nbsp;JavaServer Pages&nbsp;(JSP), or alternately by template engines such as WebMacro. Often servlets are used in conjunction with JSPs in a pattern called &quot;Model 2&quot;, which is a flavor of the model-view-controller pattern.</p>

    <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    The original servlet specification was created by Sun Microsystems (version 1.0 was finalized in June 1997). Starting with version 2.3, the servlet specification was developed under the Java Community Process. JSR 53 defined both the Servlet 2.3 and JavaServer Page 1.2 specifications. JSR 154 specifies the Servlet 2.4 and 2.5 specifications. As of May 10, 2006, the current version of the servlet specification is 2.5.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />

    In his blog on java.net, Sun veteran and GlassFish lead Jim Driscoll details the history of servlet technology. James Gosling first thought of servlets in the early days of Java, but the concept did not become a product until Sun shipped the Java Web Server product. This was before what is now the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition was made into a specification.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />

    A Web container is a computer program that runs Web applications. Web containers are also sometimes called Web engines. Like the other Java APIs, different vendors provide their own implementation. Below is a list of some of the free web containers. (Note that &#39;free&#39; means that commercial use is free. Some of the commercial containers, e.g. Resin and Orion, make ideal development containers and are also free to use in a server environment for non-profit organizations).<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />

    There is one thing in Java source code that is neither a class nor a member of a class. That&#39;s an interface. An interface defines methods that a class implements. In other words it declares what certain classes do. However an interface itself does nothing. All the action at least, happens inside classes.&nbsp;<dfn style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">A class may implement one or more interfaces. This means that the class subscribes to the promises made by those interfaces. Since an interface promises certain methods, a class implementing that interface will need to provide the methods specified by the interface. The methods of an interface are abstract -- they have no bodies. Generally, a class implementing an interface will not only match the method specifications of the interface, it will also provide bodies -- implementations -- for its methods.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />

    For example, a ScoreCounter class might meet the contract specified by the Counting interface:<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    interface Counting<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    {<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    abstract void increment();<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    abstract int getValue();<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    }<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    So might a Stopwatch, although it might have a totally different internal representation. Both would have increment() and getValue() methods, but the bodies of these methods might look quite different. For example, a ScoreCounter for a basketball game might implement increment() so that it counts by 2 points each time, while a Stopwatch might call its own increment() method even if no one else does.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    A class that implements a particular interface must declare this explicitly:<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    class ScoreCounter implements Counting {<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    ....<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    }<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    If a class implements an interface, an instance of that class can also be treated as though its type were that interface. For example, it can be labeled with a name whose declared type is that interface. For example, an instance of class ScoreCounter can be labeled with a name of type Counting. It will also answer true when asked whether it&#39;s an instanceof that interface type: if myScoreCounter is a ScoreCounter, then myScoreCounter instanceof Counting is true. Similarly, you can pass or return a ScoreCounter whenever a Counting is required by a method signature.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" />
    The generality of interfaces and the inclusion of multiple implementations within a single (interface) type is an extremely powerful feature. For example, you can use a name of type Counting to label either an instance of ScoreCOunter or an instance of Stopwatch (and use its increment() and getValue() methods) without even knowing which one you&#39;ve got.</p>
